# Project 2 for CS303 - Data Structures

This project is an implementation of a Huffman Tree type data structure by using a self-made minimum heap data structure. 
The program reads in the given text file, "Sekiro.txt" in this case, and loads all of the different characters it has read into the tree. It outputs a frequency table which gives every character occurence and how often they occur. It then outputs the Huffman code that every character has been given.
